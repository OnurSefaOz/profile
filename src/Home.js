                    &emsp;My research interests are artificial intelligence, computer vision, natural language processing. I love to deal with deep learning projects
                    ,especially challenging ones. I generally propose and built deep learning models for real world scenarios.

                    enabled me to adapt several different approaches to my current projects. I am eager to find opportunities to develop this skill further.

                    &emsp;My interest in art started in high school but never ended. I do oil painting in my flat. To do so, I have organized the place to obtain a 
                    studio-like environment. Expressing my feelings through the canvas and paint mesmerizes me. I like to share my artwork with interested people.

                    &emsp;I love to watch movies from different genres. I think I born to listen music and my favorite ones are generally from metal, rock, progressive rock, techno, house,
                    or classical piano genres. I love to write stories and essays in Turkish but I can not find a leisure time to this. In summer times, I love to travel, bike, and camp.
