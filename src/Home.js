                    &emsp;I am Onur Sefa Ozcibik. I graduated from Bogazici University Computer Engineering, Turkeyâ€™s one of the most qualified universities in the field. The experience I received was precious. Even though I am only 24, I feel a bright future awaits me.

                    &emsp;My research interests are artificial intelligence, computer vision, and natural language processing. I love to deal with deep learning projects, especially challenging ones. I generally propose and build deep learning models for real-world scenarios.

                    &emsp;I previously attended CoLoRs AI Lab and NLP Lab at Bogazici University. Continuous searching, reading, and implementing state-of-the-art papers
                    enabled me to adapt several different approaches to my current projects. I am eager to find opportunities to develop this skill further.

                    &emsp;My interest in art started in high school but never ended. I do oil painting in my flat. To do so, I have organized the place to obtain a 
                    studio-like environment. Expressing my feelings through the canvas and paint mesmerizes me. I like to share my artwork with people. 
                    Also, they can be viewed through this <a href="/art">platform</a> and my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/artvoke/">Instagram page</a>.

                    &emsp;I love to watch movies from different genres. I think I was born to listen to music and my favorite genres are metal, rock, progressive rock, techno, house,
                    and classical piano. I love to write stories and essays in Turkish but I can not find leisure time for this activity anymore. In summer times, I love traveling, biking, and camping.
